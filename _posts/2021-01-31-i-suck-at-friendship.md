There. I said it. I suck at friendship.

And before you get all "Oh, no, it's fine, you're OK. You're just ... insert some kind of excuse here" on me, let me clarify a little: I am 100% okay with sucking at friendship. I don't believe that I'm meant to be friendly.

Recently I ended an almost-3-year friendship. It was bound to happen, really. For many reasons.

1. Recently all of our discussions revolved around a specific portion of her life. And despite the fact that I'd not only pointed this out (to be ignored), and changed the subject, it would immediately return to the original subject.
2. Because of (1), I'd been annoyed at every attempt she made to converse. I'd literally roll my eyes at every notification I got on my phone, often followed by me muttering "What does she want now?"
3. Did I mention I suck at friendship?
4. Maybe there weren't all that many reasons.

But I began to wonder what it was specifically about this friendship that made it hard to maintain (I mean, aside from the above). I have other friendships that have lasted far longer. And in my mind, I began to name them out and it hit me: every one of those friends were male.

I'm not your stereotypical female, so forgive me for breaking into stereotypes.

Female friendships are emotional investments. There's an emotional bank where, if there's not a deposit of emotions on a regular basis, the bank gets angry and resentful and then you have to invest more to make up for the lack of investment. One has to have quite a nest egg of emotional funds in order to keep up with that kind of thing.

And emotional funds are one thing I've lacked my entire life. I'm emotional-funds-poor.

There have been times where I've questioned whether I'm a sociopath or a narcissist.

Because all of the above? I don't really care about.

I'm not a person who needs people. I'd make a very good hermit, and if I didn't have a family, I'd ditch everyone and everything to live in the woods away from all humans.

The reason my male friendships have been entirely more successful than any female friendship I've ever had is because they require little-to-no emotional investment. Even when there's a problem, or someone had a bad day, or is going through some shit, quiet camaraderie is perfectly acceptable. Much support can be conveyed simply through as simple statement like "Dude..."

Did I mention yet that I suck at friendship?

And no, it still doesn't bother me.
