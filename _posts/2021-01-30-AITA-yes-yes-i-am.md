So, late 2020 I was here in SK on my break after a significant snowfall. My driveway had been mostly cleared, but the end was built up with the snow that the plow had so graciously left (mea culpa, I wasn't here to deal with it before it froze).

While I was in the house doing some work, I heard the neighbour's snowblower out front and I look outside to see him snow-blowing the end of my driveway. What a gent! I immediately went out and insisted on giving him $100 for the work, I was VERY grateful.

He said to me then, well, you know, I could keep on eye on your driveway and keep it clear for you while you're away, and I thought, gee, what a nice man. And really, it was very nice. I accepted his offer. But see, being the silly person I am, I thought he was just offering. I didn't think it was some kind of contract for services to be rendered. But that was dumb of me. I didn't know this guy, and he didn't know me, he didn't owe me a thing. But none of that dawned on me until tonight.

After last night's drama, and my subsequent police statement, I've been quite certain that I'll be seeing some form of retaliation. Around here, that usually means a rock through a window, a knife in your tire, or some other form of vandalism. So, I've been regularly going out to check on my vehicle that's parked in the driveway. On my last check, I noticed an envelope under my wipers. I had no idea what to expect.

I brought it inside and here it was a bill from my neighbour for the services he'd rendered so far. I got offended at first. He offered, how dare he then turn around and charge me for the work. I even sent a picture of the bill to my husband and scoffed at the idea that he would want payment. But, really, why WOULDN'T he want payment? And why would I get so offended over being billed for services rendered? The more I thought about it, the more I felt like an idiot. Getting mad over someone billing me for work they've done. Total asshole move.

Anyway, I took his bill and wrote a note at the bottom, thanking him for being so kind as to use his own time and equipment to make sure my driveway stayed clear, and then paid him double his ask.

It's strange the things we get offended about in our lives. I know I get pissed off about a lot of things. Stupid things. Unimportant things. But when God kicks me in the pants and tells me to get my act together, I'm glad for the lesson, because I know I needed it.
