**TRIGGER WARNING: This post discusses mental disorders, suicide, molestation, alcoholism, attempted murder, manslaughter, and just... a lot of bad things. If you are sensitive to any of these, please do NOT read further.**

Today I talked with my mother and finally asked a lot of questions that I'd never asked before. I'm not sure if it was because I felt like I couldn't or shouldn't ask, because of their sensitive nature, or if I just really didn't care enough to know. But today I asked. Some of the details I'm sharing below I did already know, but some is all brand new to me.

My maternal grandmother's name was Marion. She married my grandfather Art sometime in the 1950s. My grandmother could not carry a pregnancy to term, with her longest term being 28 weeks (which was her pregnancy with my mother - her only successful pregnancy), and she had four children who died at birth, two girls, Cheryle Ann and Valerie, and two boys - I'm unsure of the boys' names.

Around 1960, my grandmother's father told my grandfather to leave my grandmother and mother and never have contact with them again. He was an alcoholic, and while I can't be sure, there may have been other reasons as well for his demand that Art leave Marion and my mom (which I will discuss later.) My mother was 3 years old.

Even before my mother was born, there were clear issues. He had been charged with manslaughter when he hit a man who was walking along the road with his truck. There are also news articles I've since found that go into detail about incidents from my grandfather's alcoholism, and I'm not sure he ever did stop drinking, but it took until after I was born for my mother to finally track him down and make contact with him. At that point, he was remarried and had a daughter, my half-aunt Bev.

My grandmother would remarry twice. Her second husband I don't know a lot about other than his last name and that he had a son from a previous marriage. Her third husband was a philanderer. When my grandmother questioned him as to why he didn't just leave her and marry his mistress, he responded "We're just waiting for you to die." When he did finally leave her, he put a bottle of alcohol and bottles of pills on her nightstand beside her bed.

My grandmother was bi-polar, and the act of him leaving the bottle and pills beside her bed lead to him being charged with attempted murder. That was my grandmother's last marriage.

She'd attempted multiple times to commit suicide. Between pills and alcohol, at least two car wrecks (one of which resulted in the death of a passenger in her vehicle), she didn't want to stay on this planet. It also was determined shortly after one of the incidents that she'd had multiple aneurysms.

After the death of her father, she'd disappear now and then, and she'd always turn up at the same spot - the oceanside where they'd spread his ashes. She'd go there to talk to him.

In an attempt to assist her with her bi-polar disorder, they gave her shock treatments. I'm not sure what effect they thought they would have, and I'm not sure if any of those treatments contributed to her aneurysms or not, but suffice it to say, she was not healed.

When my mother was 16, my grandmother was finally successful in her attempts to commit suicide. My mother was given the task of packing up their house, and then she was moved across country to live with an uncle that she really didn't know. Shortly after moving in with him, he began sexually assaulting her.

My grandfather, having remarried and having another daughter with his second wife, was also a sexual predator. He molested his intellectually disabled daughter - we're not certain of the length of time that this went on or when it started, but he was charged and convicted and spent time in prison. All of this came to light after my mother finally tracked him down, and he came with his wife and daughter to see us in Ontario.

Since we are unsure as to when his predation on my aunt started, it's possible that this also could have been a factor in my great-grandfather demanding that he leave his wife and my mother when my mother was 3 years old. This is simply a theory.

It's a lot to take in. Like I said, there are some things I already knew, some things that I'd had glimpses of, but there were some things I didn't know.

My mother made a lot of mistakes in her life - and continues to make a lot of mistakes. I know a portion of these mistakes she's made can be directly linked to her past, and while I do take that into consideration, I still have to take into consideration my own family and the effects her actions might have on them, so as of last year, I all but completely cut her out of my life.

I don't know exactly why I decided to share this other than for the sake of catharsis.

Please note: I am not the type of person to accept sympathy, especially in regards to situations like the above. If your response to this is an apology, please withhold it. Life is life, and bad things happen, and bad things result from those bad events. I just know that I needed to get all of this out.
