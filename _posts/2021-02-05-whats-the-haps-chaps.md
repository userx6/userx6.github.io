So, remember me complaining about certain people not preparing for the potential of not being able to come in to work? You might not, it doesn't matter. Anyway, thankfully I was prepared. Because despite that someone's assertion and confidence that they'd be working until May, they are now on medical leave.

Thankfully this also happened during the time I happened to be in town, so I was able to step in and take over. I've got a week in trying to get everything organized to my requirements, and I've got at least one more week to go. I'm moving as much as I can online in order to manage everything remotely and changing up processes to make them more efficient. Not that they were terribly inefficient before. They were efficient in an analog world, but not so in the digital world we now live in. And especially not in a world where I need to be able to access data from where ever I may be at any given time.

In fact, I need to go work on a spreadsheet right now.
