1. What did you do in 2020 that you’d never done before?

I went to Hawaii. My mother-in-law had mentioned to me one day in 2019 that she'd never been to Hawaii, and that her husband would probably never take her, so I booked everything and took her and my best friend and we had an amazing time. The day we were flying back from Hawaii, Justin Trudeau announced that Canadians needed to return home because of COVID-19.

2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?

The only NYR that I ever make anymore is about reading. I did not reach my goal, but I do believe I read some high quality books.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth or get pregnant?

My best friend became pregnant with her very first child. I laugh about this because we're fairly close in age, and she's just starting out having kids, and I'm all done.

4. Did anyone close to you get married?

My friend Sara married my cousin!

5. Did anyone close to you die?

Two old friends died. One from COVID-19, the other from overdose.

6. Travel?

See (1). I miss Hawaii, too. The atmosphere was something I'd never experienced anywhere in any of my travels. The entire island was gorgeous, also, and nothing beats swimming in the ocean.

7. Did you move anywhere?

Surprisingly, I did not.

8. What was the best month?

February and March. Probably more March, as the entire family got COVID-19 in February after the man and I came back from Vegas.

9. What would you like to have in 2021 that you lacked in 2020?

I'd like more time to engage in my other pursuits - reading, painting, drawing, wood-burning. I don't want to spend my entire year neck-deep in work.

10. What date(s) from 2020 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?

March 8 to 14th. My trip to Hawaii.

11. What was your biggest achievement of the year?

It might be weird to say, but probably discovering that my great-grandfather was not actually my great-grandfather and then finding (and meeting!) some of my new-found family.

12. What was your biggest failure?

My biggest failure was allowing work to take control of so much of my life to the point that it was also affecting my health.

13. Did you suffer illness or injury?

COVID-19 and stress-related garbage.

14. What was the best thing you bought?

My plants.
My friend's photos.
My Raspberry Pi 400.

15. Whose behavior merited celebration?

Honestly, my oldest. He turned 16 in 2020, and other than base teenage angst, he really has done SO well this year. I love being able to discuss more important things with him.

16. Whose behavior made you appalled and/or depressed?

Not even going there.

17. Where did most of your money go?

Tea. Clothes. Plants. Tech.

18. What did you get really, really, really excited about?

Hawaii. Also, moving. To the country. To eat a lot of peaches. Or rather, just to get away from humans.

19. What song(s) will always remind you of 2020?

Unfinished Business - Mumford & Sons
Take It All Back - Judah & The Lion
13 Beaches - Lana Del Rey

20. Compared to this time last year, are you:

Happier or Sadder? Crabbier.
Richer or Poorer? Richer, I guess, but who cares?
Thinner or fatter? Fatter!

21. What do you wish you’d done more of?

I wish I'd taken more time with the kids outside of the city, but with lockdowns and whatever... I also wish I'd read more.

22. What do you wish you’d done less of?

Work. But I guess I was just doing what was required of me at the time.

23. How will you be spending New Year’s Eve/Day?

New Years Eve I was driving from North Battleford to Edmonton to come ring in the New Year with my kids (which I then did), and then New Years Day was spent being lazy.

24. What was an unexpected surprise?

Finding out that after 36 years of believing I was Italian, I discovered I'm actually Irish and that my great-grandmother carried on a years-long affair that resulted in at least 3 children.

25. Did you fall in love in 2020?

No.

26. What was the best concert you’ve been to this year?

The in-house entertainment at The Rim restaurant in Hawaii.

27. What was your favorite TV program?

The Good Place. The Haunting of Hill House. The Haunting of Bly Manor. Manhunt: Unabomber.

28. Do you dislike anyone now that you didn’t dislike this time last year?

Probably, but those people aren't worth the time to mention.

29. What was the best book you read?

I can't pick a specific one, but surprisingly none of the ones that come to mind are fiction.
Waco - David Thibodeau, Leon Whiteson, Aviva Layton
The Worst Hard Time - Timothy Egan
Oswald Chambers - David McCasland
Becoming Nobody - Ram Dass
Highway of Tears - Jessica McDiarmid
Empire of the Summer Moon - SC Gwynne

30. What was your greatest musical discovery?

Lana Del Rey, Judah & The Lion, and the "Indie Christian" genre.

31. What did you want and get?

More pumpkins?

32. What did you want and not get?

To get out of the city and into the country.

33. What was your favorite film of this year?

I've watched many good movies this year, but none really strike me as being mentionable.

34. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?

Uhhhhh, that was almost a year ago. But a few days later, I flew to Vegas to attend a lacrosse game (oh, I miss lacrosse!). That's how I got COVID-19.

35. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?

A decrease in work, or a relocation.

36. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2020?

Pajama pants, snarky t-shirts, and quarantine bangs.

37. What kept you sane?

I... don't know.

38. What political issue stirred you the most?

All of the bullshit. From all sides. But primarily from one specific side.

39. Who did you miss?

My dad. I did get to see him and we went out on a houseboat together (which was a DISASTER, but a memorable one), but I haven't seen him since July and it's killing me.

My brother and his wife and their girls. Because of COVID, I wasn't allowed to see any of them when I went to visit my dad (my SIL is a nurse), so it has been a very long time since I've seen them.

40. Favorite new person?

His name is Miguel. That's all I have to say right now.

Five things that 2020 taught me:

The entire world and everything you know about it can change in an instant.
"Appreciation of other artists (photographers, in my case) doesn’t mean you have to measure yourself by their work. Their opportunities, their brains, their budgets are not yours; do the best you can with what you have, learn, improve where you learn, keep doing your own thing. Art isn’t a zero-sum game." (Stealing this from my twin because it is definitely something I've learned this year in my own art.)
I really love plants. Even though I have a black thumb.
To sleep in the middle of my bed.
Alcohol makes me chill.
Five things you want to do in 2021:
I want to move. I need to move. Out to the country. Away from humans and prying eyes.
MORE ART.
More reading.
Visit my dad as much as COVID allows.
Learn new skills.
EXTRA: I want to start writing a book.
