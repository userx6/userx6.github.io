If I had a nickel for every time I was asked this question in my life, I'd have a lot of nickels. It wasn't until I was in my late 20s (28, to be exact), that I actually discovered the answers to this question (and let me tell you, it was a significant relief to finally understand myself.)

Aspergers Syndrome
------------------

I had no idea about Aspergers until I was diagnosed with it. I knew about autism, and had taught a few autistic children in my time as a Sunday School teacher. But Aspergers? What on earth was it? What did it mean for me? After researching it, and finally understanding it, this was the biggest source of relief for me.

I spent most of my youth mentally exhausted from trying to blend in, to seem normal, to adapt to the ways of other young girls my age. I "lucked out" for a few years where all of my peers were male, who are far easier to adapt to, in my opinion. I won't get into all the details of what Aspergers entails, but suffice it to say, reading the "symptoms" of Aspergers, especially those found in girls, was such a relief.

ADD
---

I kind of always assumed I had some form of ADD/ADHD. It wasn't so much that I was hyperactive, but I'd be in the middle of a conversation with someone and completely zone out and think about something entirely different.

OCD
---

My OCD runs concurrent to my Aspergers. I was always accused of being OCD, but I didn't really understand why. The mix of Aspergers, ADD, and OCD are really highlighted in my memories for the things I'd do when I was young, never fully understanding the urge, but always giving in to them.

ICD
---

My impulse control disorder comes in three flavours - none of which I'm going to expound on here. When I was diagnosed with ICD, I was also told that I probably shouldn't drink, but honestly, when you're dealing with what I'm dealing with, the alcohol sure makes things a lot lovelier.

Brain Damage
------------

This is a fun one. Apparently, I have fairly extensive brain damage. I don't remember what part of my brain is damaged, but given they placed the blame for the damage on the massive amount of concussions I've had in my life, I'm going to assume it's either my frontal or temporal lobe. The damage apparently just makes all the above worse.
